# Music-Search-Engine
 
#The Requirements & Task Overview:  
To work collaboratively, as a project group to build a front-end web application. 
As a team we are tasked with conceiving & executing a design that solves a real-world problem. 
By integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. 
Employing agile development methodologies to integrate 2 server side APIs. 
Using Bootstrap techniques to curate an interactive & polished UI. 
Establishing client-side storage to store persistent data.

#The Idea: 
Front-end web application. 
User inputs musician or band.  

    Spotify API returns: 
    *Top 10 related artists
    *Related image data
    *Top 10 tracks 
    *Top 10 albums

    2nd API returns: 
    * 
    * 
    * 

    Local Storage Persists: 

#The Challenges 

#The Wireframe



ALTs:  

Or Links to web videos/URL  

Or Events – Bands in Town on Github  

 

#User Story:  
 As A user 

I want a webpage application that searches the name of given artist  

& Displays the artist’s YouTube/Spotify videos & Wikipedia page.  

Save the last user search in local storage  

 

#Wireframing Example:  

https://www.midomi.com/ 

 

#APIs:  

YouTube/Spotify – Artist’s music videos displayed to page  

- latest 3 albums  

- top 10 tracks  

 

Wiki – Artist's Wiki printed to page  

 

#Breakdown of Tasks: 

Rui:   

*Bootstrap  

*UI design 

*Implementing code/refactoring  

*Strengths: Combining APIs & local storage 

 
Kassy:  

*Presenting,  

*Assisting with YouTube API,  

*Generating ReadMe file,  

*Overseeing project management tool & team organisation  

 
Jack :  

*Implementing YouTube/Spotify functionality  

 
Amal :  

*Implementing Wiki functionality  

 

#Considerations:  

*Naming conventions  

*Apis – Jack & Amal complete a call early on/upfront to ensure we can utlise both APIs o 

*Wiki API- has a limit of 200 calls per key -  

 

#Further Considerations  

*Page opens with background image  

*Background images changes after inputting search – hopefully to image of the band or artist  

*Top of page is artist’s Wiki 

*Then print info from Spotify (TBC – possibly events) 

*Possibly print event info from Bands in Town (search API)   

*Save to local storage - user search history  

*Navigate back to homepage/top with logo - Top left logo to navigate back to homepage 

*1 HTML page 

*Footer to display user search history  

*Homepage is going to be clean only holding background image & search bar  

*Team/Who built this page? Images/Avatar, Links to Github pages & LinkedIn 

 

#Project Management Tool  

https://trello.com/b/zVBXZjZE/mse 

 

Group Meeting – 5/1/22 

Changed direction from to Bands in Town due to complex nature of employing Wikipages  

Moved away from displaying top 10 tracks to top 10 artists  

Using top 10 artists we will create buttons able to utilise the bands in town event info   

   
#Challenges
• Redesigning page after facing challenges syncing APIs
