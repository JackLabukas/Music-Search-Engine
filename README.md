# Music-Search-Engine
 
The Requirements & Task Overview:  
To work collaboratively, as a project group to build a front-end web application. 
As a team we are tasked with conceiving & executing a design that solves a real-world problem. 
By integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. 
Employing agile development methodologies to integrate 2 server side APIs. 
Using Bootstrap techniques to curate an interactive & polished UI. 
Establishing client-side storage to store & persistent data.

The Idea: 
Front-end web application
User inputs musician or band
The APIs Returns - 

via Spotify API: 
    Displays Top 10 Related Artists
    Prints Image Data
    Displays Top 10 Tracks 
    Display Top 10 Albums

via MS Bing API: 
    Updates background image to artist or band 
   

Local Storage Persists: 
    User's search history 

User Story:  
As A user; \n
I WANT a webpage application that searches the name of given music artist or band.  \n
&, Displays selected artistâ€™s information via Spotify & a second API. \n
To learn more about music. \n

The Challenges 
Agreeing the concept  
Identifying viable APIs with relevant functionality 
Integrating multiple APIs
Using agile development methodologies to work collaboratively
Connecting regularly as a team debug & improve design 
Collectively developing & improving functionality 
Deciding on Git workflow & agreed methodology for pull requests
Using Trello team technology - to collaborate efficiently & effectively
A movement away from Bands in Town API, due to restricted database & unaligned capabilities
