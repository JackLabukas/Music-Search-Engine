#Project Name:  

Music Search Engine 

 
 
#Project Description:  

User inputs a musician or band into search bar 

Using  Wikipedia & YouTube/Spotify API’s 

The application prints the artist’s Wikipedia page & then lists Spotify info  

ALTs:  

Or Links to web videos/URL  

Or Events – Bands in Town on Github  

 

#User Story:  
 As A user 

I want a webpage application that searches the name of given artist  

& Displays the artist’s YouTube/Spotify videos & Wikipedia page.  

Save the last user search in local storage  

 

#Wireframing Example:  

https://www.midomi.com/ 

 

#APIs:  

YouTube/Spotify – Artist’s music videos displayed to page  

- latest 3 albums  

- top 10 tracks  

 

Wiki – Artist's Wiki printed to page

#Considerations:  

*Naming conventions  

*Apis – Jack & Amal complete a call early on/upfront to ensure we can utlise both APIs o 

*Wiki API- has a limit of 200 calls per key -  

 

#Further Considerations  

*Page opens with background image  

*Background images changes after inputting search – hopefully to image of the band or artist  

*Top of page is artist’s Wiki 

*Then print info from Spotify (TBC – possibly events) 

*Possibly print event info from Bands in Town (search API)   

*Save to local storage - user search history  

*Navigate back to homepage/top with logo - Top left logo to navigate back to homepage 

*1 HTML page 

*Footer to display user search history  

*Homepage is going to be clean only holding background image & search bar  

*Team/Who built this page? Images/Avatar, Links to Github pages & LinkedIn

Group Meeting – 5/1/22 

Changed direction from to Bands in Town due to complex nature of employing Wikipages  

Moved away from displaying top 10 tracks to top 10 artists  

Using top 10 artists we will create buttons able to utilise the bands in town event info
